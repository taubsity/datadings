Mark B. Faries;Robert M. Elashoff;Completion Dissection or Observation for Sentinel-Node Metastasis in Melanoma;1011;2017;2;78.5;New England Journal of Medicine;"Background: Sentinel-lymph-node biopsy is associated with increased melanoma-specific survival (i.e., survival until death from melanoma) among patients with node-positive intermediate-thickness melanomas (1.2 to 3.5 mm). The value of completion lymph-node dissection for patients with sentinel-node metastases is not clear. Methods: In an international trial, we randomly assigned patients with sentinel-node metastases detected by means of standard pathological assessment or a multimarker molecular assay to immediate completion lymph-node dissection (dissection group) or nodal observation with ultrasonography (observation group). The primary end point was melanoma-specific survival. Secondary end points included disease-free survival and the cumulative rate of nonsentinel-node metastasis. Results: Immediate completion lymph-node dissection was not associated with increased melanoma-specific survival among 1934 patients with data that could be evaluated in an intention-to-treat analysis or among 1755 patients in the per-protocol analysis. In the per-protocol analysis, the mean (±SE) 3-year rate of melanoma-specific survival was similar in the dissection group and the observation group (86±1.3% and 86±1.2%, respectively; P=0.42 by the log-rank test) at a median follow-up of 43 months. The rate of disease-free survival was slightly higher in the dissection group than in the observation group (68±1.7% and 63±1.7%, respectively; P=0.05 by the log-rank test) at 3 years, based on an increased rate of disease control in the regional nodes at 3 years (92±1.0% vs. 77±1.5%; P<0.001 by the log-rank test); these results must be interpreted with caution. Nonsentinel-node metastases, identified in 11.5% of the patients in the dissection group, were a strong, independent prognostic factor for recurrence (hazard ratio, 1.78; P=0.005). Lymphedema was observed in 24.1% of the patients in the dissection group and in 6.3% of those in the observation group. Conclusions: Immediate completion lymph-node dissection increased the rate of regional disease control and provided prognostic information but did not increase melanoma-specific survival among patients with melanoma and sentinel-node metastases.";;Massimo Fioranelli, Maria Grazia Roccia, Carlo Pastore, Carolina Jahaira Aracena, Torello Lotti;Randomized controlled trial;;Cutaneous Melanoma;;
Ulrike Leiter;Claus Garbe;Final Analysis of DeCOG-SLT: No Survival Benefit for Complete Lymph Node Dissection in Sentinel-Positive Melanoma;156;2019;2;41.9;Journal of Clinical Oncology;"Purpose: We have previously reported on the 3-year results of the phase III German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group trial (DeCOG; ClinicalTrials.gov identifier: NCT02434107) comparing distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), recurrence-free survival (RFS), and overall survival (OS) in patients with positive sentinel lymph-node biopsy who were randomly assigned to complete lymph node dissection (CLND) or observation. Here, we report the final analysis with 72 months of median follow up. Patients and methods: The multicenter randomized phase III trial included patients with cutaneous melanoma of the trunk and extremities who were randomly assigned (1:1) to undergo CLND or observation. DMFS was analyzed as the primary end point, and RFS, OS, and recurrences in the regional lymph node basin were secondary end points. The analysis was by intention to treat. Disease and survival information were collected quarterly. Results: From January 2006 to December 2014, 5,547 patients were screened to identify 1,256 with metastases in the sentinel lymph node (SLN). Of these, 483 (39%) were included: 241 in the observation arm and 242 in the CLND arm. In the final analysis, median follow up was 72 months (interquartile range, 67-77 months). No significant treatment-related difference was seen in the 5-year DMFS between the observation and CLND arms (67.6% v 64.9%, respectively; hazard ratio [HR], 1.08; P = .87). The 5-year RFS and OS also showed no difference (HR, 1.01 and 0.99, respectively). Grade 3 and 4 adverse effects occurred in 32 patients (13%) in the CLND arm; lymphedema (n = 20) and delayed wound healing (n = 5) were most common and no serious adverse events were reported. Conclusion: The final results of the German Dermatologic Cooperative Oncology Group trial with a median follow up of 72 months showed higher event rates, but similar HRs compared with those at the 3-year analysis. These results confirm that immediate CLND in SLN-positive patients is not superior to observation in terms of DMFS, RFS, or OS and support not recommending CLND in patients with SLN metastasis.";;Ulrike Leiter, Rudolf Stadler, Cornelia Mauch, Werner Hohenberger, Norbert H Brockmeyer, Carola Berking, Cord Sunderkötter, Martin Kaatz, Kerstin Schatton, Percy Lehmann, Thomas Vogt, Jens Ulrich, Rudolf Herbst, Wolfgang Gehring, Jan-Christoph Simon, Ulrike Keim, Danielle Verver, Peter Martus, Claus Garbe;Randomized controlled phase 3 trial;;Cutaneous melanoma with positive sentinel node;;

Methods An ASCO-SSO panel was formed, and a systematic review of the literature was conducted regarding SLN biopsy and completion lymph node dissection (CLND) after a positive sentinel node in patients with melanoma. Results Nine new observational studies, two systematic reviews, and an updated randomized controlled trial of SLN biopsy, as well as two randomized controlled trials of CLND after positive SLN biopsy, were included. Recommendations Routine SLN biopsy is not recommended for patients with thin melanomas that are T1a (nonulcerated lesions < 0.8 mm in Breslow thickness). SLN biopsy may be considered for thin melanomas that are T1b (0.8 to 1.0 mm Breslow thickness or < 0.8 mm Breslow thickness with ulceration) after a thorough discussion with the patient of the potential benefits and risk of harms associated with the procedure. SLN biopsy is recommended for patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas (T2 or T3; Breslow thickness of > 1.0 to 4.0 mm). SLN biopsy may be recommended for patients with thick melanomas (T4; > 4.0 mm in Breslow thickness), after a discussion of the potential benefits and risks of harm. In the case of a positive SLN biopsy, CLND or careful observation are options for patients with low-risk micrometastatic disease, with due consideration of clinicopathological factors. For higher-risk patients, careful observation may be considered only after a thorough discussion with patients about the potential risks and benefits of foregoing CLND. Important qualifying statements outlining relevant clinicopathological factors and details of the reference patient populations are included within the guideline.";;Sandra L Wong, Mark B Faries, Erin B Kennedy, Sanjiv S Agarwala, Timothy J Akhurst, Charlotte Ariyan, Charles M Balch, Barry S Berman, Alistair Cochran, Keith A Delman, Mark Gorman, John M Kirkwood, Marc D Moncrieff, Jonathan S Zager, Gary H Lyman;Clinical practice guideline (evidence‑based);;Cutaneous Melanoma;;
Donald L Morton;Mark B Faries;Final Trial Report of Sentinel-Node Biopsy versus Nodal Observation in Melanoma (MSLT-I);1125;2014;2;78.5;New England Journal of Medicine;"Background: Sentinel-node biopsy, a minimally invasive procedure for regional melanoma staging, was evaluated in a phase 3 trial. Methods: We evaluated outcomes in 2001 patients with primary cutaneous melanomas randomly assigned to undergo wide excision and nodal observation, with lymphadenectomy for nodal relapse (observation group), or wide excision and sentinel-node biopsy, with immediate lymphadenectomy for nodal metastases detected on biopsy (biopsy group). Results No significant treatment-related difference in the 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was seen in the overall study population (20.8% with and 79.2% without nodal metastases). Mean (± SE) 10-year disease-free survival rates were significantly improved in the biopsy group, as compared with the observation group, among patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas, defined as 1.20 to 3.50 mm (71.3 ± 1.8% vs. 64.7 ± 2.3%; hazard ratio for recurrence or metastasis, 0.76; P=0.01), and those with thick melanomas, defined as >3.50 mm (50.7 ± 4.0% vs. 40.5 ± 4.7%; hazard ratio, 0.70; P=0.03). Among patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas, the 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate was 62.1 ± 4.8% among those with metastasis versus 85.1 ± 1.5% for those without metastasis (hazard ratio for death from melanoma, 3.09; P<0.001); among patients with thick melanomas, the respective rates were 48.0 ± 7.0% and 64.6 ± 4.9% (hazard ratio, 1.75; P=0.03). Biopsy-based management improved the 10-year rate of distant disease-free survival (hazard ratio for distant metastasis, 0.62; P=0.02) and the 10-year rate of melanoma-specific survival (hazard ratio for death from melanoma, 0.56; P=0.006) for patients with intermediate-thickness melanomas and nodal metastases. Accelerated-failure-time latent-subgroup analysis was performed to account for the fact that nodal status was initially known only in the biopsy group, and a significant treatment benefit persisted. Conclusions: Biopsy-based staging of intermediate-thickness or thick primary melanomas provides important prognostic information and identifies patients with nodal metastases who may benefit from immediate complete lymphadenectomy. Biopsy-based management prolongs disease-free survival for all patients and prolongs distant disease-free survival and melanoma-specific survival for patients with nodal metastases from intermediate-thickness melanomas.";;Donald L Morton, John F Thompson, Alistair J Cochran, Nicola Mozzillo, Omgo E Nieweg, Daniel F Roses, Harold J Hoekstra, Constantine P Karakousis, Christopher A Puleo, Brendon J Coventry, Mohammed Kashani-Sabet, B Mark Smithers, Eberhard Paul, William G Kraybill, J Gregory McKinnon, He-Jing Wang, Robert Elashoff, Mark B Faries;Randomized controlled phase 3 trial;;Cutaneous melanoma;;
Tina J Hieken;Sandra L Wong;The Role of Completion Lymph Node Dissection for Sentinel Lymph Node-Positive Melanoma;15;2019;5;3.5;Annals of Surgical Oncology;Purpose and MethodsCompletion lymph node dissection (CLND) for sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive melanoma patients has been guideline-concordant standard of care since adoption of lymphatic mapping and SLN biopsy for the management of clinically node-negative melanoma patients more than 20years ago. However, a trend for omission of CLND has been observed over the past decade, and we now have randomized, controlled clinical trial data to help guide treatment recommendations. Publication of these data prompted an American Society of Clinical OncologySociety of Surgical Oncology 2018 clinical practice guideline update for these patients.Results and ConclusionsSystematic review of current evidence supports a selective, individualized approach to CLND for SLN-positive melanoma. For low-risk, low-volume micrometastatic disease, SLN biopsy may be both diagnostic and therapeutic, and close clinical follow-up with imaging or CLND are reasonable options for appropriately selected patients. For higher-risk patients, omission of CLND requires careful consideration of risks versus benefits, relevant histopathology, and individualized patient discussion. This should address patient comorbidities and life expectancy, the predicted likelihood of additional positive nodes, availability of imaging surveillance, likelihood of adherence to imaging and clinical follow-up, consequences of regional recurrence, and the prognostic value of complete nodal staging and its impact on adjuvant therapy recommendations or clinical trial participation. Data on long-term outcomes, cost, and patient-reported quality of life measures are not yet available.;;Tina J Hieken, John M Kane 3rd, Sandra L Wong;Narrative review / expert opinion;;Sentinel‑node‑positive cutaneous melanoma;;
Karolina Richter;Wojciech M Wysocki;Does It Really Pay Off? Lymphadenectomy versus Observation in Sentinel-Positive Melanoma – Systematic Review and Meta-Analysis;6;2022;1;2.9;Journal of Clinical Medicine;"The aim of this meta-analysis was to answer the question as to whether performing CLND (complete lymph node dissection) is necessary in every case of the melanoma patient after the positive SNB (sentinel node biopsy). To resolve doubts the authors reanalyzed previous articles and systematized the knowledge about the concerning medical problem. The databases such as PubMed, Scopus and Web of Science were screened to find articles that will be helpful to answer the controversial question if performing lymphadenectomy is crucial. The inclusion criteria consisted of randomized clinical trials, comparison of lymphadenectomy versus observation and positive sentinel node biopsy. After which, seven articles were examined. Authors analyzed parameters such as: recurrence, 3-year survival and 5-year survival. There was no relationship between the performance of CLND and melanoma recurrence (OR 1.04; 95% CI: 0.82-1.31; p = 0.75). However, no CLND group had higher 3-year survival (OR 1.22; 95% CI: 1.03-1.44; p = 0.02) and 5-year survival (OR 1.30; 95% CI: 1.19-1.85; p = 0.008). In conclusion, the observational approach to the melanoma patients with positive sentinel node biopsy is associated with comparable or slightly improved 3- and 5-year survival, then in case of routine lymphadenectomy. Although, in each melanoma patient a decision to perform or withhold lymphadenectomy should always be considered individually. Patients with low perioperative risk could be considered for surgical approach.";;Karolina Richter, Tomasz Stefura, Krzysztof Macheta, Jonasz Tempski, Jakub Kazo?, Magdalena Szeremeta, Pawe?

Athanassios Kyrgidis;Alexander Stratigos;Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy Followed by Lymph Node Dissection for Localized Melanoma (Cochrane Review);27;2015;1;9.4;Cochrane Database of Systematic Reviews;"Background Melanoma is the leading cause of skin cancer-associated mortality. The vast majority of newly diagnosed melanomas are confined to the primary cutaneous site. Surgery represents the mainstay of melanoma treatment. Treatment strategies include wide excision of the primary tumour and sentinel lymph node biopsy (SLNB) to assess the status of the regional nodal basin(s). SLNB has become an important component of initial melanoma management providing accurate disease staging. Objectives To assess the effects and safety of SLNB followed by completion lymph node dissection (CLND) for the treatment of localised primary cutaneous melanoma. Search methods We searched the following databases up to February 2015: the Cochrane Skin Group Specialised Register, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials (CENTRAL) in The Cochrane Library (2015, Issue 1), MEDLINE (from 1946), EMBASE (from 1974), and LILACS ((Latin American and Caribbean Health Science Information database, from 1982). We also searched the following from inception: African Index Medicus, IndMED of India, Index Medicus for the South-East Asia Region, and six trials registers. We checked the reference lists of included and excluded studies for further references to relevant randomised controlled trials (RCTs). We searched ISI Web of Science Conference Proceedings from inception to February 2015, and we scanned the abstracts of major dermatology and oncology conference proceedings up to 2015. Selection criteria Two review authors independently assessed all RCTs comparing SLNB followed by CLND for the treatment of primary localised cutaneous melanoma for inclusion. Primary outcome measures were overall survival and rate of treatment complications and side effects. Data collection and analysis Two review authors independently extracted and analysed data on survival and recurrence, assessed risk of bias, and collected adverse effect information from included trials. Main results We identified and included a single eligible trial comparing SLNB with observation and published in eight different reports (from 2005 to 2014) with 2001 participants. This did not report on our first primary outcome of overall survival. The study did report on the rate of treatment complications. Our secondary outcomes of disease-specific and disease-free survival, local recurrence and distant metastases were reported. There were 1347 participants in the intermediate-thickness melanoma group and 314 in the thick melanoma group. With regard to treatment complications, short-term surgical morbidity (30 days) in 1735 participants showed no difference between SLNB and observation (risk ratio [RR] 1.11; 95% confidence interval [CI] 0.9 to 1.37) for wide excision of the tumour site but favoured observation for complications related to the regional nodal basin (RR 14.36; 95% CI 6.74 to 30.59). The study did not report the actual 10-year melanoma-specific survival rate for all included participants. Instead, melanoma-specific survival rates for each group of participants: intermediate-thickness melanoma (defined as 1.2 to 3.5mm) and thick melanomas (defined as 3.50 mm or more) was reported. In the intermediate-thickness melanoma group there was no statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival between study groups at 10 years (81.4 +/- 1.5% versus 78.3 +/- 2.0%, hazard ratio [HR] 0.84; 95% CI 0.65 to 1.09). In the thick melanoma group, again there was no statistically significant difference in disease-specific survival between study groups at 10 years (58.9.3 +/- 4.1% versus 64.4 +/- 4.6%, HR 1.12; 95% CI 0.77 to 1.64). Combining these groups there was some heterogeneity (I-2 = 34%) but the total HR was not statistically significant (HR 0.92; 95% CI 0.74 to 1.14). This study failed to show any difference for its stated primary outcome. The summary estimate for disease-free survival at 10 years favoured SLNB over observation in participants with intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas (HR 0.75; 95% CI 0.63 to 0.89). With regard to the rate of local and regional recurrence as the site of first recurrence, a benefit of SLNB uniformly existed in both groups of participants with intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas (RR 0.56; 95% CI 0.45 to 0.69). This is in contrast with a uniformly unfavourable effect of SLNB with regard to the rate of distant metastases as site of first recurrence, in both groups of participants with intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas (HR 1.33; 95% CI 1.03 to 1.72). Authors' conclusions We contacted the trial authors querying the lack of data on overall survival which was the primary outcome of their important study. They stated ""there are numerous additional analyses that have yet to be reported for the trial"". We expect that overall survival data will be available in a future update of this review. Disease-free survival and rate of local and regional recurrence favoured SLNB in both groups of participants with intermediate-thickness and thick melanomas but short-term surgical morbidity was higher in the SLNB group, especially with regard to complications in the nodal basin. The evidence for the outcomes of interest in this review is of low quality due to the risk of bias and imprecision of the estimated effects. Further research may have an important impact on our estimate of the effectiveness of SLNB in managing primary localised cutaneous melanoma. Currently this evidence is not sufficient to document a benefit of SLNB when compared to observation in individuals with primary localised cutaneous melanoma.";;Athanassios Kyrgidis, Thrasivoulos Tzellos, Simone Mocellin, Zoe Apalla, Aimilios Lallas, Pierluigi Pilati, Alexander Stratigos;Systematic review & meta‑analysis of RCTs;;Primary localized cutaneous melanoma;;
Claus Garbe;Mario Mandala;European Consensus-Based Interdisciplinary Guideline for Melanoma. Part 2: Treatment – Update 2024;13;2025;1;7.1;European Journal of Cancer;"A unique collaboration of multi-disciplinary experts from the European Association of Dermato-Oncology (EADO), the European Dermatology Forum (EDF), and the European Organization of Research and Treatment of Cancer (EORTC) was formed to make recommendations on cutaneous melanoma diagnosis and treatment, based on systematic literature reviews and the experts' experience. Cutaneous melanomas are excised with one to two-centimeter safety margins. For a correct stage classification and treatment decision, a sentinel lymph node biopsy shall be offered in patients with tumor thickness ? 1.0 mm or ? 0.8 mm with additional histological risk factors, although there is as yet no clear survival benefit for this approach. Therapeutic decisions should be primarily made by an interdisciplinary oncology team (""Tumor Board""). Adjuvant therapies can be proposed in completely resected stage IIB-IV. In stage II only PD-1 inhibitors are approved. In stage III anti-PD-1 therapy or dabrafenib plus trametinib for patients with BRAFV600 mutated melanoma can be discussed. In resected stage IV, nivolumab can be offered, as well as ipilimumab and nivolumab, in selected, high-risk patients. In patients with clinically detected macroscopic, resectable disease, neoadjuvant therapy with ipilimumab plus nivolumab followed complete surgical resection and adjuvant therapy according to pathological response and BRAF status can be offered. Neoadjuvant therapy with pembrolizumab followed by complete surgical resection and adjuvant pembrolizumab is also recommended. For patients with disease recurrence after (neo) adjuvant therapy, further treatment should consider the type of (neo) adjuvant therapy received as well as the time of recurrence, i.e., on or off therapy. In patients with irresectable stage III/IV disease systemic treatment is always indicated. For first line treatment PD-1 antibodies alone or in combination with CTLA-4 or LAG-3 antibodies shall be considered. In stage IV melanoma with a BRAFV600 mutation, first-line therapy with BRAF/MEK inhibitors can be offered as an alternative to immunotherapy, in selected cases. In patients with primary resistance to immunotherapy and harboring a BRAFV600 mutation, this therapy shall be offered as second line. Other second line therapies include therapy with tumor infiltrating lymphocytes and combinations of immune checkpoint inhibitors not used in first line.

F C Wright; T Petrella;Primary Excision Margins, Sentinel Lymph Node Biopsy, and Completion Lymph Node Dissection in Cutaneous Melanoma: A Clinical Practice Guideline;36;2019;1;3.4;Current Oncology;Background: For patients who are diagnosed with early-stage cutaneous melanoma, the principal therapy is wide surgical excision of the primary tumour and assessment of lymph nodes. The purpose of the present guideline was to update the 2010 Cancer Care Ontario guideline on wide local excision margins and sentinel lymph node biopsy (slnb), including treatment of the positive sentinel node, for melanomas of the trunk, extremities, and head and neck. Methods: Using Ovid, the medline and embase electronic databases were systematically searched for systematic reviews and primary literature evaluating narrow compared with wide excision margins and the use of slnb for melanoma of the truck and extremities and of the head and neck. Search timelines ran from 2010 through week 25 of 2017. Results: Four systematic reviews were chosen for inclusion in the evidence base. Where systematic reviews were available, the search of the primary literature was conducted starting from the end date of the search in the reviews. Where systematic reviews were absent, the search for primary literature ran from 2010 forward. Of 1213 primary studies identified, 8 met the inclusion criteria. Two randomized controlled trials were used to inform the recommendation on completion lymph node dissection.Key updated recommendations include:? Wide local excision margins should be 2 cm for melanomas of the trunk, extremities, and head and neck that exceed 2 mm in depth.? slnb should be offered to patients with melanomas of the trunk, extremities, and head and neck that exceed 0.8 mm in depth.? Patients with sentinel node metastasis should be considered for nodal observation with ultrasonography rather than for completion lymph node dissection.;;F C Wright, L H Souter, S Kellett, A Easson, C Murray, J Toye, D McCready, C Nessim, D Ghazarian, N J Look Hong, S Johnson, D P Goldstein, T Petrella;Clinical practice guideline (evidence‑based);;Cutaneous Melanoma;;

Hayley Standage;Dale Han;What Is the Cost-Effective Treatment for Melanoma Patients with a Positive Sentinel Node?;5;2021;5;3.5;Annals of Surgical Oncology;Background: Survival for positive sentinel lymph node (SLN) patients does not differ between completion lymph node dissection (CLND) and nodal observation (OBS). However, treating these patients with CLND and checkpoint inhibitors, such as pembrolizumab (PEM), improves outcomes. This study evaluated the cost-effectiveness of OBS, CLND, and CLND with PEM (CLND-PEM) treatments. Methods: A Markov model was designed to simulate treatment for a theoretical cohort of 1000 positive SLN patients per therapy with a 5-year follow-up period. An intervention was cost-effective if its incremental cost-effectiveness ratio among therapies was below the willingness-to-pay threshold of $100,000 per quality-adjusted life year (QALY). Results: Compared with CLND or CLND-PEM, OBS resulted in fewer lymphedema cases but in more disease recurrences. Compared with OBS, CLND had higher costs and lower QALYs. Although CLND-PEM had a lower number of recurrences and deaths than OBS or CLND, it had higher costs and lower QALYs than OBS, and thus was not cost-effective. However, with the effects of CLND from CLND-PEM removed, allowing evaluation of PEM effects alone (PEM alone), the resulting QALYs were the highest, but PEM alone still was not cost-effective compared with OBS ($1.2 million per QALY). By reducing the drug cost to less than $14,404 per patient, PEM alone would become cost-effective. Conclusions: Compared with CLND, CLND-PEM, and PEM alone, OBS was cost-effective for managing positive SLN patients. Although CLND-PEM and PEM alone result in fewer recurrences and deaths, these therapies were not cost-effective due to the quality-of-life decrement of CLND and the current high drug cost of PEM.;;Hayley Standage, Alyssa R.

Kristy Kummerow Broman;Jonathan S. Zager;Active Surveillance of Patients Who Have Sentinel Node-Positive Melanoma: Adoption and Early Outcomes After MSLT-II;64;2021;3;5.1;Cancer;"Background: For patients with sentinel lymph node (SLN)-positive cutaneous melanoma, the Second Multicenter Selective Lymphadenectomy trial demonstrated equivalent disease-specific survival (DSS) with active surveillance using nodal ultrasound versus completion lymph node dissection (CLND). Adoption and outcomes of active surveillance in clinical practice and in adjuvant therapy recipients are unknown. Methods: In a retrospective cohort of SLN-positive adults treated at 21 institutions in Australia, Europe, and the United States from June 2017 to November 2019, the authors evaluated the impact of active surveillance and adjuvant therapy on all-site recurrence-free survival (RFS), isolated nodal RFS, distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and DSS using Kaplan-Meier curves and Cox proportional hazard models. Results: Among 6347 SLN biopsies, 1154 (18%) were positive and had initial negative distant staging. In total, 965 patients (84%) received active surveillance, 189 (16%) underwent CLND. Four hundred thirty-nine patients received adjuvant therapy (surveillance, 38%; CLND, 39%), with the majority (83%) receiving anti-PD-1 immunotherapy. After a median follow-up of 11 months, 220 patients developed recurrent disease (surveillance, 19%; CLND, 22%), and 24 died of melanoma (surveillance, 2%; CLND, 4%). Sixty-eight patients had an isolated nodal recurrence (surveillance, 6%; CLND, 4%). In patients who received adjuvant treatment without undergoing prior CLND, all isolated nodal recurrences were resectable. On risk-adjusted multivariable analyses, CLND was associated with improved isolated nodal RFS (hazard ratio [HR], 0.36; 95% CI, 0.15-0.88), but not all-site RFS (HR, 0.68; 95% CI, 0.45-1.02). Adjuvant therapy improved all-site RFS (HR, 0.52; 95% CI, 0.47-0.57). DSS and DMFS did not differ by nodal management or adjuvant treatment. Conclusions: Active surveillance has been adopted for most SLN-positive patients. At initial assessment, real-world outcomes align with randomized trial findings, including in adjuvant therapy recipients.";;Kristy Kummerow Broman, Tasha Hughes, Lesly Dossett, James Sun, Dennis Kirichenko, Michael J.
