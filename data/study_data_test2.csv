Schadendorf;Pakull 2;Tumor Analyses Reveal Squamous Transformation;2000;2013;3a;9.9;Dermatology;"Purpose: Patterns of resistance to first-line osimertinib are not well-established and have primarily been evaluated using plasma assays, which cannot detect histologic transformation and have differential sensitivity for copy number changes and chromosomal rearrangements.

Experimental design: To characterize mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib, patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers who received osimertinib at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and had next-generation sequencing performed on tumor tissue before osimertinib initiation and after progression were identified.

Results: Among 62 patients who met eligibility criteria, histologic transformation, primarily squamous transformation, was identified in 15% of first-line osimertinib cases and 14% of later-line cases. Nineteen percent (5/27) of patients treated with first-line osimertinib had off-target genetic resistance (2 MET amplification, 1 KRAS mutation, 1 RET fusion, and 1 BRAF fusion) whereas 4% (1/27) had an acquired EGFR mutation (EGFR G724S). Patients with squamous transformation exhibited considerable genomic complexity; acquired PIK3CA mutation, chromosome 3q amplification, and FGF amplification were all seen. Patients with transformation had shorter time on osimertinib and shorter survival compared with patients with on-target resistance. Initial EGFR sensitizing mutation, time on osimertinib treatment, and line of therapy also influenced resistance mechanism that emerged. The compound mutation EGFR S768 + V769L and the mutation MET H1094Y were identified and validated as resistance mechanisms with potential treatment options.

Conclusions: Histologic transformation and other off-target molecular alterations are frequent early emerging resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and are associated with poor clinical outcomes.See related commentary by Piotrowska and Hata, p. 2441.";10,20,30,200;Adam J Schoenfeld, Joseph M Chan, Daisuke Kubota, Hiroki Sato, Hira Rizvi, Yahya Daneshbod, Jason C Chang, Paul K Paik, Michael Offin, Maria E Arcila, Monika A Davare, Ujwal Shinde, Dana Pe'er, Natasha Rekhtman, Mark G Kris;RCT;Randomisiert, blind, vergleich;Lunge;Ja;Nein
Pretzel;Erylmaz;Dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer;2001;2015;1a;12.3;Cancer;"Background: Effective treatments for patients with cholangiocarcinoma after progression on gemcitabine-based chemotherapy are urgently needed. Mutations in the BRAF gene have been found in 5% of biliary tract tumours. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has shown activity in several BRAFV600E-mutated cancers. We aimed to assess the activity and safety of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer.

Methods: This study is part of an ongoing, phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, Rare Oncology Agnostic Research (ROAR) basket trial in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated rare cancers. Patients were eligible for the biliary tract cancer cohort if they were aged 18 years or older, had BRAFV600E-mutated, unresectable, metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent biliary tract cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received previous systemic treatment. All patients were treated with oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and oral trametinib 2 mg once daily until disease progression or intolerance of treatment. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate, which was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat evaluable population, which comprised all enrolled patients regardless of receiving treatment who were evaluable (ie, had progression, began a new anticancer treatment, withdrew consent, died, had stable disease for 6 weeks or longer, or had two or more post-baseline assessments). The ROAR trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02034110. These results are based on an interim analysis; the study is active but not recruiting.

Findings: Between March 12, 2014, and July 18, 2018, 43 patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer were enrolled to the study and were evaluable. Median follow-up was 10 months (IQR 6-15). An investigator-assessed overall response was achieved by 22 (51%, 95% CI 36-67) of 43 patients. An independent reviewer-assessed overall response was achieved by 20 (47%, 95% CI 31-62) of 43 patients. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse event was increased γ-glutamyltransferase in five (12%) patients. 17 (40%) patients had serious adverse events and nine (21%) had treatment-related serious adverse events, the most frequent of which was pyrexia (eight [19%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.";2,3,4,5;Vivek Subbiah, Ulrik Lassen, Elena Élez, Antoine Italiano, Giuseppe Curigliano, Milind Javle, Filippo de Braud, Gerald W Prager, Richard Greil, Alexander Stein, Angelica Fasolo;RCT;Blind;Haut;Nein;Ja
Hoffmann;Schmidt;Long-term efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy for advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma;1850;2018;2b;8.7;Oncology Reports;"Objective: To evaluate the long-term efficacy of neoadjuvant chemotherapy followed by radiotherapy for locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.

Methods: From January 2010 to December 2012, 128 patients with stage III-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. All patients received three cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m²) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m²) every 3 weeks followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS).

Results: After a median follow-up of 78.9 months, the 5-year OS, PFS, DMFS, and LRFS rates were 78.3%, 71.2%, 81.5%, and 87.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that N stage was an independent prognostic factor for OS, PFS, and DMFS (all P < 0.05). Treatment-related adverse events during chemotherapy were mainly grade 1 to 2. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and neutropenia was 22.7% and 14.8%, respectively. During radiotherapy, the most common grade 3 toxicities were mucositis (35.9%) and dermatitis (28.1%).

Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin followed by IMRT showed promising long-term survival outcomes with manageable toxicity profile for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.";15,30,45,89;Thomas Hoffmann, Michael Schmidt, Liora Chen, Victoria Roberts, Jasmine Li, Robert Klein, Samuel Taylor, William Johnson, Anna Lopez, Thomas Williams;Kohortenstudie;Prospektiv, multicenter;Kopf-Hals;Ja;Nein
Chen;Williams;Immunotherapy plus standard of care for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis;2456;2019;1a;25.5;The Lancet Oncology;"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the treatment landscape for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several trials have shown improved outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for stage IV NSCLC.

Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and online conference proceedings of major oncology meetings from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2018. We included published or presented phase 2 or 3 trials in patients with advanced NSCLC who received no previous systemic treatment, and who were randomly assigned to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. We extracted data on overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response, and grades 3–5 adverse events. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were pooled using random-effects models.

Results: Our search identified 1,432 studies, of which eight trials (four phase 3 and four phase 2) with 4,648 patients were included in our analyses. The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall survival (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64–0.87; p=0.0002) and progression-free survival (0.65, 0.58–0.72; p<0.0001). The benefit was consistent across different immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy regimens, and histological subtypes. Objective response was also improved with the combination (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.66–2.75; p<0.0001). Grades 3–5 adverse events were more common with immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone (risk ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.04–1.24; p=0.005).

Interpretation: The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for stage IV NSCLC prolongs survival and increases tumour response compared with chemotherapy alone, at the expense of increased toxicity. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy as a new standard of care for stage IV NSCLC.";102,189,256,398;Liora Chen, Thomas Williams, Robert Klein, Samuel Taylor, William Johnson, Anna Lopez, Victoria Roberts, Jasmine Li, Michael Schmidt, Thomas Hoffmann;Metaanalyse;Systematische Review;Lunge;Ja;Ja
Zhang;Li;Targeting PARP inhibition in BRCA-mutated breast cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials;1780;2020;1a;15.8;Clinical Cancer Research;"Purpose: PARP inhibitors have shown promising activity in BRCA-mutated breast cancer. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PARP inhibitors in patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts up to March 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PARP inhibitors with conventional therapy in patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and adverse events (AEs). Hazard ratios (HRs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models.

Results: Four RCTs involving 1,098 patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer were included. PARP inhibitors significantly improved PFS compared with conventional therapy (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78; P<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in OS (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66-1.16; P=0.352). PARP inhibitors were associated with higher ORR (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.24-2.32; P=0.001) and CBR (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14-1.65; P=0.001) compared with conventional therapy. Regarding safety, PARP inhibitors were associated with increased risks of anemia (RR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.45-4.14; P=0.001) and neutropenia (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.15-2.43; P=0.007), but not nausea, vomiting, or fatigue.

Conclusions: PARP inhibitors significantly improved PFS, ORR, and CBR compared with conventional therapy in patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer, albeit with increased hematologic toxicities. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the impact on OS.";67,98,132,178;Wei Zhang, Jing Li, Mei Wang, Sheng Liu, Xia Chen, Huawei Yang, Jian Zhou, Qing Yang, Fang Wang, Yan Sun;Metaanalyse;Systematische Review;Mamma;Ja;Ja
Muller;Tanaka;Phase III trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with autologous tumor-pulsed dendritic cells in patients with high-risk melanoma;1549;2017;1b;18.2;Journal of Clinical Oncology;"Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunotherapy with autologous tumor-pulsed dendritic cells in patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma.

Methods: In this open-label, randomized phase III trial, patients with completely resected stage III or IV melanoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant dendritic cell vaccine therapy or observation. Dendritic cells were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, pulsed with autologous tumor lysate, and administered intradermally every 2 weeks for the first 6 doses, then monthly for 6 additional doses. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), safety, and immunologic response.

Results: Between January 2012 and December 2015, 214 patients were enrolled (107 in each arm). After a median follow-up of 40.9 months, median RFS was 22.2 months (95% CI, 14.8-29.6) with dendritic cell vaccine versus 11.6 months (95% CI, 8.5-14.7) with observation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.93; P=0.016). Three-year RFS rates were 42.3% versus 27.8%, respectively. Median OS was not reached in the vaccine arm versus 55.5 months (95% CI, 41.6-69.4) in the observation arm (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.08; P=0.107). The most common adverse events with dendritic cell vaccine were injection-site reactions (86.0%), fatigue (46.7%), and flu-like symptoms (38.3%). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 5.6% of patients receiving dendritic cell vaccine, with no treatment-related deaths.

Conclusions: Adjuvant immunotherapy with autologous tumor-pulsed dendritic cells significantly improved RFS in patients with high-risk melanoma, with a favorable safety profile. These findings suggest that dendritic cell-based vaccines may be an effective adjuvant therapy for patients with resected melanoma at high risk for recurrence.";64,87,103,132;Andreas Muller, Hiroshi Tanaka, Rebecca Wilson, David Thompson, Sarah Johnson, Markus Weber, Christian Schmidt, Nathalie Martin, Sophia Chen, Philip Morris;RCT;Randomisiert, open-label;Haut;Ja;Nein
Johnson;Weber;Neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab in early-stage colon cancer with mismatch repair deficiency;956;2022;2a;14.2;Nature Medicine;"Background: Mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colon cancers respond well to immune checkpoint inhibition in the metastatic setting. We investigated the efficacy of neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab in patients with early-stage dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer.

Methods: In this single-arm, phase 2 trial, patients with clinical stage T3-4, N0-2, M0 dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer received ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) plus nivolumab (3 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for two doses before surgery. The primary endpoint was major pathological response (MPR), defined as ≤10% viable tumor cells. Secondary endpoints included pathological complete response (pCR), safety, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and correlative studies of the tumor microenvironment.

Results: Between March 2020 and May 2021, 35 patients were enrolled. Among 32 evaluable patients, 28 (87.5%, 95% CI 71.0-96.5) achieved MPR, including 24 (75.0%, 95% CI 56.6-88.5) who achieved pCR. All patients underwent complete surgical resection, with no delays in surgery due to treatment-related adverse events. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 6 patients (17.1%), including elevated liver enzymes (n=2), colitis (n=2), and rash (n=2). At a median follow-up of 13.1 months, RFS was 100%. Analysis of paired pre- and post-treatment samples demonstrated significant increases in CD8+ T-cell infiltration and reductions in FOXP3+ regulatory T cells after treatment.

Conclusions: Neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab induced a high rate of MPR and pCR in early-stage dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer, with manageable toxicity. These findings suggest that a neoadjuvant immunotherapy approach may be effective for patients with early-stage dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer and could potentially change treatment paradigms for this patient population.";32,67,98,112;Sarah Johnson, Markus Weber, Rebecca Wilson, David Thompson, Andreas Muller, Hiroshi Tanaka, Christian Schmidt, Nathalie Martin, Sophia Chen, Philip Morris;Phase-II;Open-label, single-arm;Kolorektal;Ja;Nein
Garcia;Yoshida;Circulating tumor DNA as a biomarker for treatment response monitoring in metastatic colorectal cancer;1228;2021;2b;21.6;New England Journal of Medicine;"Background: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker for monitoring treatment response in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We assessed the utility of ctDNA analysis for early treatment response assessment and prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with mCRC receiving first-line therapy.

Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study of 184 patients with previously untreated mCRC starting first-line chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy. Blood samples were collected at baseline, after cycle 1 (3 weeks), after cycle 2 (6 weeks), and at radiographic assessment (8-12 weeks). Plasma ctDNA was analyzed using next-generation sequencing targeting a panel of 74 genes. The primary endpoint was the association between early ctDNA dynamics and objective response by RECIST v1.1 criteria. Secondary endpoints included the correlation between ctDNA changes and PFS and OS.

Results: At baseline, ctDNA was detectable in 177 patients (96.2%). After one treatment cycle, a relative decrease in ctDNA of ≥80% from baseline was observed in 99 patients (53.8%) and was strongly associated with objective response (odds ratio, 7.3; 95% CI, 3.6-14.8; P<0.001). Patients with a ≥80% decrease in ctDNA after one cycle had significantly longer median PFS (11.1 vs. 5.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26-0.54; P<0.001) and OS (32.5 vs. 15.3 months; HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.55; P<0.001) compared with patients with <80% decrease. Early ctDNA dynamics remained significantly associated with PFS and OS in multivariable analyses adjusting for established prognostic factors. Serial ctDNA monitoring identified molecular progression a median of 3.1 months (range, 0.5-8.3) before radiographic progression.

Conclusions: Early ctDNA dynamics strongly predict treatment response, PFS, and OS in patients with mCRC receiving first-line therapy. Serial ctDNA analysis may enable early assessment of treatment efficacy and detection of disease progression before radiographic evidence, supporting its use as a biomarker for treatment monitoring in mCRC.";56,87,124,165;Carlos Garcia, Akira Yoshida, Maria Rodriguez, John Parker, Elena
