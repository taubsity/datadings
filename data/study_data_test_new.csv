Green;Strutton;Reduced Melanoma After Regular Sunscreen Use: Randomized Trial Follow‑Up;800;2011;1b;32.0;Journal of Clinical Oncology;"Purpose: Regular sunscreen use prevents cutaneous squamous‑cell carcinoma long‑term, but its effect on melanoma is controversial. In a community‑based RCT (Nambour, Australia; n = 1 621), adults were randomized to daily versus discretionary SPF16 sunscreen from 1992‑1996 and followed until 2006. Results: Daily sunscreen users developed 11 melanomas versus 22 in the discretionary group (HR 0.50, 95% CI 0.24‑1.02; P = 0.051). Invasive melanomas were reduced 73 %. Conclusion: Long‑term daily sunscreen substantially lowers melanoma risk.";30,45,60,75;"Green AC, Williams GM, Logan V, Strutton GM";Randomized‑controlled trial;Hoch;Cutaneous melanoma;Nein;Nein
Saes da Silva;Zhang;Use of Sunscreen and Risk of Melanoma and Non‑Melanoma Skin Cancer: A Systematic Review and Meta‑analysis;150;2018;1a;1.9;European Journal of Dermatology;"Background: Evidence on sunscreen effectiveness for melanoma remains mixed. Methods: 29 studies (25 case‑control, 2 cohort, 1 cross‑sectional, 1 RCT) totaling 313 717 participants were pooled. Results: Overall sunscreen use was not significantly associated with melanoma risk (pooled OR 1.10, 95 % CI 0.92‑1.33; I² = 89 %). Conclusions: Current data show no increased melanoma risk, yet protective benefit was not confirmed, highlighting heterogeneity and confounding.";10,20,25,30;"Saes da Silva E, Tavares R, da Silva Paulitsch F, Zhang L";Systematic review & meta‑analysis;Hoch;Cutaneous melanoma;Nein;Ja
Ghiasvand;Veierød;Sunscreen Use and Subsequent Melanoma Risk: A Population‑Based Cohort Study;300;2016;2b;32.0;Journal of Clinical Oncology;"Objective: To prospectively evaluate sunscreen SPF level and melanoma. Design: Norwegian Women and Cancer cohort (n = 145 973) with 1 532 incident melanomas over 14 years. Results: Using SPF ≥15 vs <15 reduced melanoma risk (HR 0.67, 95 % CI 0.53‑0.83). Population‑attributable fraction suggested 18 % fewer melanomas if all women used SPF ≥15. Conclusion: Higher‑SPF sunscreen use is associated with a significant risk reduction.";25,35,40,45;"Ghiasvand R, Weiderpass E, Green AC, Lund E, Veierød MB";Prospective cohort study;Moderat;Cutaneous melanoma;Nein;Nein
Cust;Whiteman;Sunscreen Use and Melanoma Risk Among Young Australian Adults;120;2018;2b;11.8;JAMA Dermatology;"Importance: Data on sunscreen and early‑onset melanoma are limited. Methods: Population‑based case‑control study (604 melanomas, 1 080 controls) aged 18‑40 years. Regular childhood sunscreen use was linked to 35‑40 % lower melanoma risk (adjusted OR 0.65, 95 % CI 0.50‑0.85). Conclusion: Consistent sunscreen use from childhood confers meaningful protection in young adults.";12,18,20,25;"Cust AE, Janda M, Whiteman DC, et al.";Case‑control study;Moderat;Cutaneous melanoma;Nein;Nein
