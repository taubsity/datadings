Schadendorf;Pakull 2;Tumor Analyses Reveal Squamous Transformation;2000;2013;3a;9.9;Dermatology;"Purpose: Patterns of resistance to first-line osimertinib are not well-established and have primarily been evaluated using plasma assays, which cannot detect histologic transformation and have differential sensitivity for copy number changes and chromosomal rearrangements.

Experimental design: To characterize mechanisms of resistance to osimertinib, patients with metastatic EGFR-mutant lung cancers who received osimertinib at Memorial Sloan Kettering Cancer Center and had next-generation sequencing performed on tumor tissue before osimertinib initiation and after progression were identified.

Results: Among 62 patients who met eligibility criteria, histologic transformation, primarily squamous transformation, was identified in 15% of first-line osimertinib cases and 14% of later-line cases. Nineteen percent (5/27) of patients treated with first-line osimertinib had off-target genetic resistance (2 MET amplification, 1 KRAS mutation, 1 RET fusion, and 1 BRAF fusion) whereas 4% (1/27) had an acquired EGFR mutation (EGFR G724S). Patients with squamous transformation exhibited considerable genomic complexity; acquired PIK3CA mutation, chromosome 3q amplification, and FGF amplification were all seen. Patients with transformation had shorter time on osimertinib and shorter survival compared with patients with on-target resistance. Initial EGFR sensitizing mutation, time on osimertinib treatment, and line of therapy also influenced resistance mechanism that emerged. The compound mutation EGFR S768 + V769L and the mutation MET H1094Y were identified and validated as resistance mechanisms with potential treatment options.

Conclusions: Histologic transformation and other off-target molecular alterations are frequent early emerging resistance mechanisms to osimertinib and are associated with poor clinical outcomes.See related commentary by Piotrowska and Hata, p. 2441.";10,20,30,200;Adam J Schoenfeld, Joseph M Chan, Daisuke Kubota, Hiroki Sato, Hira Rizvi, Yahya Daneshbod, Jason C Chang, Paul K Paik, Michael Offin, Maria E Arcila, Monika A Davare, Ujwal Shinde, Dana Pe'er, Natasha Rekhtman, Mark G Kris;RCT;Randomisiert, blind, vergleich;Lunge;Ja;Nein
Pretzel;Erylmaz;Dabrafenib plus trametinib in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer;2001;2015;1a;12.3;Cancer;"Background: Effective treatments for patients with cholangiocarcinoma after progression on gemcitabine-based chemotherapy are urgently needed. Mutations in the BRAF gene have been found in 5% of biliary tract tumours. The combination of dabrafenib and trametinib has shown activity in several BRAFV600E-mutated cancers. We aimed to assess the activity and safety of dabrafenib and trametinib combination therapy in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer.

Methods: This study is part of an ongoing, phase 2, open-label, single-arm, multicentre, Rare Oncology Agnostic Research (ROAR) basket trial in patients with BRAFV600E-mutated rare cancers. Patients were eligible for the biliary tract cancer cohort if they were aged 18 years or older, had BRAFV600E-mutated, unresectable, metastatic, locally advanced, or recurrent biliary tract cancer, an Eastern Cooperative Oncology Group performance status of 0-2, and had received previous systemic treatment. All patients were treated with oral dabrafenib 150 mg twice daily and oral trametinib 2 mg once daily until disease progression or intolerance of treatment. The primary endpoint was the overall response rate, which was determined by Response Evaluation Criteria in Solid Tumors version 1.1 in the intention-to-treat evaluable population, which comprised all enrolled patients regardless of receiving treatment who were evaluable (ie, had progression, began a new anticancer treatment, withdrew consent, died, had stable disease for 6 weeks or longer, or had two or more post-baseline assessments). The ROAR trial is registered with ClinicalTrials.gov, NCT02034110. These results are based on an interim analysis; the study is active but not recruiting.

Findings: Between March 12, 2014, and July 18, 2018, 43 patients with BRAFV600E-mutated biliary tract cancer were enrolled to the study and were evaluable. Median follow-up was 10 months (IQR 6-15). An investigator-assessed overall response was achieved by 22 (51%, 95% CI 36-67) of 43 patients. An independent reviewer-assessed overall response was achieved by 20 (47%, 95% CI 31-62) of 43 patients. The most common grade 3 or worse adverse event was increased γ-glutamyltransferase in five (12%) patients. 17 (40%) patients had serious adverse events and nine (21%) had treatment-related serious adverse events, the most frequent of which was pyrexia (eight [19%]). No treatment-related deaths were reported.";2,3,4,5;Vivek Subbiah, Ulrik Lassen, Elena Élez, Antoine Italiano, Giuseppe Curigliano, Milind Javle, Filippo de Braud, Gerald W Prager, Richard Greil, Alexander Stein, Angelica Fasolo;RCT;Blind;Haut;Nein;Ja

Methods: From January 2010 to December 2012, 128 patients with stage III-IVB nasopharyngeal carcinoma were enrolled. All patients received three cycles of docetaxel (75 mg/m²) plus cisplatin (75 mg/m²) every 3 weeks followed by intensity-modulated radiotherapy (IMRT). The primary endpoint was 5-year overall survival (OS). Secondary endpoints included progression-free survival (PFS), distant metastasis-free survival (DMFS), and locoregional relapse-free survival (LRFS).

Results: After a median follow-up of 78.9 months, the 5-year OS, PFS, DMFS, and LRFS rates were 78.3%, 71.2%, 81.5%, and 87.6%, respectively. Multivariate analysis showed that N stage was an independent prognostic factor for OS, PFS, and DMFS (all P < 0.05). Treatment-related adverse events during chemotherapy were mainly grade 1 to 2. The incidence of grade 3 or 4 leukopenia and neutropenia was 22.7% and 14.8%, respectively. During radiotherapy, the most common grade 3 toxicities were mucositis (35.9%) and dermatitis (28.1%).

Conclusion: Neoadjuvant chemotherapy with docetaxel plus cisplatin followed by IMRT showed promising long-term survival outcomes with manageable toxicity profile for patients with locoregionally advanced nasopharyngeal carcinoma.";15,30,45,89;Thomas Hoffmann, Michael Schmidt, Liora Chen, Victoria Roberts, Jasmine Li, Robert Klein, Samuel Taylor, William Johnson, Anna Lopez, Thomas Williams;Kohortenstudie;Prospektiv, multicenter;Kopf-Hals;Ja;Nein
Chen;Williams;Immunotherapy plus standard of care for stage IV non-small-cell lung cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis;2456;2019;1a;25.5;The Lancet Oncology;"Background: Immune checkpoint inhibitors have changed the treatment landscape for advanced non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC). Several trials have shown improved outcomes with immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy compared with chemotherapy alone. We aimed to assess the efficacy and safety of combining immune checkpoint inhibitors with chemotherapy as first-line treatment for stage IV NSCLC.

Methods: We did a systematic review and meta-analysis of randomised controlled trials. We searched MEDLINE, Embase, the Cochrane Central Register of Controlled Trials, and online conference proceedings of major oncology meetings from Jan 1, 2010, to Dec 31, 2018. We included published or presented phase 2 or 3 trials in patients with advanced NSCLC who received no previous systemic treatment, and who were randomly assigned to receive immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy or chemotherapy alone. We extracted data on overall survival, progression-free survival, objective response, and grades 3–5 adverse events. Hazard ratios (HRs) and 95% CIs were pooled using random-effects models.

Results: Our search identified 1,432 studies, of which eight trials (four phase 3 and four phase 2) with 4,648 patients were included in our analyses. The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to chemotherapy significantly prolonged overall survival (HR 0.74, 95% CI 0.64–0.87; p=0.0002) and progression-free survival (0.65, 0.58–0.72; p<0.0001). The benefit was consistent across different immune checkpoint inhibitors, chemotherapy regimens, and histological subtypes. Objective response was also improved with the combination (odds ratio 2.14, 95% CI 1.66–2.75; p<0.0001). Grades 3–5 adverse events were more common with immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy than with chemotherapy alone (risk ratio 1.14, 95% CI 1.04–1.24; p=0.005).

Interpretation: The addition of immune checkpoint inhibitors to standard chemotherapy as first-line treatment for stage IV NSCLC prolongs survival and increases tumour response compared with chemotherapy alone, at the expense of increased toxicity. These findings provide strong evidence supporting the use of immune checkpoint inhibitors plus chemotherapy as a new standard of care for stage IV NSCLC.";102,189,256,398;Liora Chen, Thomas Williams, Robert Klein, Samuel Taylor, William Johnson, Anna Lopez, Victoria Roberts, Jasmine Li, Michael Schmidt, Thomas Hoffmann;Metaanalyse;Systematische Review;Lunge;Ja;Ja
Zhang;Li;Targeting PARP inhibition in BRCA-mutated breast cancer: a meta-analysis of randomized clinical trials;1780;2020;1a;15.8;Clinical Cancer Research;"Purpose: PARP inhibitors have shown promising activity in BRCA-mutated breast cancer. We performed a meta-analysis to evaluate the efficacy and safety of PARP inhibitors in patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer.

Methods: We searched PubMed, Embase, the Cochrane Library, and conference abstracts up to March 2020 for randomized controlled trials (RCTs) comparing PARP inhibitors with conventional therapy in patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer. Primary outcomes were progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS). Secondary outcomes included objective response rate (ORR), clinical benefit rate (CBR), and adverse events (AEs). Hazard ratios (HRs) and risk ratios (RRs) with 95% confidence intervals (CIs) were calculated using random-effects models.

Results: Four RCTs involving 1,098 patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer were included. PARP inhibitors significantly improved PFS compared with conventional therapy (HR, 0.58; 95% CI, 0.43-0.78; P<0.001). However, no significant difference was observed in OS (HR, 0.87; 95% CI, 0.66-1.16; P=0.352). PARP inhibitors were associated with higher ORR (RR, 1.70; 95% CI, 1.24-2.32; P=0.001) and CBR (RR, 1.37; 95% CI, 1.14-1.65; P=0.001) compared with conventional therapy. Regarding safety, PARP inhibitors were associated with increased risks of anemia (RR, 2.45; 95% CI, 1.45-4.14; P=0.001) and neutropenia (RR, 1.67; 95% CI, 1.15-2.43; P=0.007), but not nausea, vomiting, or fatigue.

Conclusions: PARP inhibitors significantly improved PFS, ORR, and CBR compared with conventional therapy in patients with BRCA-mutated breast cancer, albeit with increased hematologic toxicities. Further studies with longer follow-up are needed to determine the impact on OS.";67,98,132,178;Wei Zhang, Jing Li, Mei Wang, Sheng Liu, Xia Chen, Huawei Yang, Jian Zhou, Qing Yang, Fang Wang, Yan Sun;Metaanalyse;Systematische Review;Mamma;Ja;Ja
Muller;Tanaka;Phase III trial of adjuvant immunotherapy with autologous tumor-pulsed dendritic cells in patients with high-risk melanoma;1549;2017;1b;18.2;Journal of Clinical Oncology;"Purpose: To evaluate the efficacy and safety of adjuvant immunotherapy with autologous tumor-pulsed dendritic cells in patients with resected stage III and IV melanoma.

Methods: In this open-label, randomized phase III trial, patients with completely resected stage III or IV melanoma were randomly assigned (1:1) to receive either adjuvant dendritic cell vaccine therapy or observation. Dendritic cells were generated from peripheral blood mononuclear cells, pulsed with autologous tumor lysate, and administered intradermally every 2 weeks for the first 6 doses, then monthly for 6 additional doses. The primary endpoint was recurrence-free survival (RFS). Secondary endpoints included overall survival (OS), safety, and immunologic response.

Results: Between January 2012 and December 2015, 214 patients were enrolled (107 in each arm). After a median follow-up of 40.9 months, median RFS was 22.2 months (95% CI, 14.8-29.6) with dendritic cell vaccine versus 11.6 months (95% CI, 8.5-14.7) with observation (hazard ratio [HR], 0.67; 95% CI, 0.48-0.93; P=0.016). Three-year RFS rates were 42.3% versus 27.8%, respectively. Median OS was not reached in the vaccine arm versus 55.5 months (95% CI, 41.6-69.4) in the observation arm (HR, 0.71; 95% CI, 0.47-1.08; P=0.107). The most common adverse events with dendritic cell vaccine were injection-site reactions (86.0%), fatigue (46.7%), and flu-like symptoms (38.3%). Grade 3-4 adverse events occurred in 5.6% of patients receiving dendritic cell vaccine, with no treatment-related deaths.

Conclusions: Adjuvant immunotherapy with autologous tumor-pulsed dendritic cells significantly improved RFS in patients with high-risk melanoma, with a favorable safety profile. These findings suggest that dendritic cell-based vaccines may be an effective adjuvant therapy for patients with resected melanoma at high risk for recurrence.";64,87,103,132;Andreas Muller, Hiroshi Tanaka, Rebecca Wilson, David Thompson, Sarah Johnson, Markus Weber, Christian Schmidt, Nathalie Martin, Sophia Chen, Philip Morris;RCT;Randomisiert, open-label;Haut;Ja;Nein
Johnson;Weber;Neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab in early-stage colon cancer with mismatch repair deficiency;956;2022;2a;14.2;Nature Medicine;"Background: Mismatch repair-deficient (dMMR) or microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H) colon cancers respond well to immune checkpoint inhibition in the metastatic setting. We investigated the efficacy of neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab in patients with early-stage dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer.

Methods: In this single-arm, phase 2 trial, patients with clinical stage T3-4, N0-2, M0 dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer received ipilimumab (1 mg/kg) plus nivolumab (3 mg/kg) every 3 weeks for two doses before surgery. The primary endpoint was major pathological response (MPR), defined as ≤10% viable tumor cells. Secondary endpoints included pathological complete response (pCR), safety, recurrence-free survival (RFS), and correlative studies of the tumor microenvironment.

Results: Between March 2020 and May 2021, 35 patients were enrolled. Among 32 evaluable patients, 28 (87.5%, 95% CI 71.0-96.5) achieved MPR, including 24 (75.0%, 95% CI 56.6-88.5) who achieved pCR. All patients underwent complete surgical resection, with no delays in surgery due to treatment-related adverse events. Grade 3-4 treatment-related adverse events occurred in 6 patients (17.1%), including elevated liver enzymes (n=2), colitis (n=2), and rash (n=2). At a median follow-up of 13.1 months, RFS was 100%. Analysis of paired pre- and post-treatment samples demonstrated significant increases in CD8+ T-cell infiltration and reductions in FOXP3+ regulatory T cells after treatment.

Conclusions: Neoadjuvant ipilimumab plus nivolumab induced a high rate of MPR and pCR in early-stage dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer, with manageable toxicity. These findings suggest that a neoadjuvant immunotherapy approach may be effective for patients with early-stage dMMR/MSI-H colon cancer and could potentially change treatment paradigms for this patient population.";32,67,98,112;Sarah Johnson, Markus Weber, Rebecca Wilson, David Thompson, Andreas Muller, Hiroshi Tanaka, Christian Schmidt, Nathalie Martin, Sophia Chen, Philip Morris;Phase-II;Open-label, single-arm;Kolorektal;Ja;Nein
Garcia;Yoshida;Circulating tumor DNA as a biomarker for treatment response monitoring in metastatic colorectal cancer;1228;2021;2b;21.6;New England Journal of Medicine;"Background: Circulating tumor DNA (ctDNA) is a promising biomarker for monitoring treatment response in patients with metastatic colorectal cancer (mCRC). We assessed the utility of ctDNA analysis for early treatment response assessment and prediction of progression-free survival (PFS) and overall survival (OS) in patients with mCRC receiving first-line therapy.

Methods: We conducted a prospective, observational study of 184 patients with previously untreated mCRC starting first-line chemotherapy with or without targeted therapy. Blood samples were collected at baseline, after cycle 1 (3 weeks), after cycle 2 (6 weeks), and at radiographic assessment (8-12 weeks). Plasma ctDNA was analyzed using next-generation sequencing targeting a panel of 74 genes. The primary endpoint was the association between early ctDNA dynamics and objective response by RECIST v1.1 criteria. Secondary endpoints included the correlation between ctDNA changes and PFS and OS.

Results: At baseline, ctDNA was detectable in 177 patients (96.2%). After one treatment cycle, a relative decrease in ctDNA of ≥80% from baseline was observed in 99 patients (53.8%) and was strongly associated with objective response (odds ratio, 7.3; 95% CI, 3.6-14.8; P<0.001). Patients with a ≥80% decrease in ctDNA after one cycle had significantly longer median PFS (11.1 vs. 5.8 months; hazard ratio [HR], 0.38; 95% CI, 0.26-0.54; P<0.001) and OS (32.5 vs. 15.3 months; HR, 0.36; 95% CI, 0.24-0.55; P<0.001) compared with patients with <80% decrease. Early ctDNA dynamics remained significantly associated with PFS and OS in multivariable analyses adjusting for established prognostic factors. Serial ctDNA monitoring identified molecular progression a median of 3.1 months (range, 0.5-8.3) before radiographic progression.

Conclusions: Early ctDNA dynamics strongly predict treatment response, PFS, and OS in patients with mCRC receiving first-line therapy. Serial ctDNA analysis may enable early assessment of treatment efficacy and detection of disease progression before radiographic evidence, supporting its use as a biomarker for treatment monitoring in mCRC.";56,87,124,165;Carlos Garcia, Akira Yoshida, Maria Rodriguez, John Parker, Elena Volkova, Sergei Ivanov, Tatsuo Miyamoto, Laura Torres, Hector Gomez, Takashi Nakamura;Kohortenstudie;Prospektiv, multicenter;Kolorektal;Ja;Nein
Richards;Park;Final analysis of KEYNOTE-189: Pembrolizumab plus chemotherapy versus placebo plus chemotherapy for previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer;3105;2020;1b;41.3;Journal of Clinical Oncology;"Background: The phase 3 KEYNOTE-189 study showed that pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum improved overall survival (OS) and progression-free survival (PFS) versus placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum in patients with previously untreated metastatic nonsquamous non-small-cell lung cancer (NSCLC) without EGFR/ALK alterations. We report the protocol-specified final analysis of KEYNOTE-189.

Methods: Patients were randomized (2:1) to pembrolizumab 200 mg or placebo every 3 weeks for up to 35 cycles plus pemetrexed 500 mg/m² and cisplatin 75 mg/m² or carboplatin AUC 5 every 3 weeks for 4 cycles, followed by maintenance pemetrexed. Crossover from the placebo-combination to pembrolizumab monotherapy was permitted for patients with verified progression. Primary endpoints were OS and PFS in the intention-to-treat population. Safety was assessed in all treated patients.

Results: Between February 2016 and March 2017, 616 patients were randomized (pembrolizumab-combination, n=410; placebo-combination, n=206). As of May 20, 2019, median follow-up was 31.0 months (range, 26.5-38.8). The pembrolizumab-combination continued to show improved OS versus the placebo-combination (median, 22.0 versus 10.6 months; HR, 0.56; 95% CI, 0.46-0.69) and PFS (median, 9.0 versus 4.9 months; HR, 0.49; 95% CI, 0.41-0.59). Estimated 24-month OS rates were 45.7% versus 27.3%. PD-L1 tumor proportion score ≥50% was associated with the greatest OS benefit (median, 28.1 versus 11.8 months; HR, 0.50; 95% CI, 0.33-0.74). Among 56 patients in the placebo-combination arm who crossed over to pembrolizumab monotherapy, median OS was 17.0 months. Treatment-related adverse events occurred in 99.8% of patients in the pembrolizumab-combination arm and 99.0% in the placebo-combination arm, including grade 3-5 events in 71.9% and 66.8%, respectively.

Conclusions: With >3 additional years of follow-up since the interim analysis, first-line pembrolizumab plus pemetrexed-platinum continued to demonstrate improved OS and PFS versus placebo plus pemetrexed-platinum in patients with metastatic nonsquamous NSCLC, despite crossover.

Kim;Lee;Comprehensive molecular profiling of advanced gastric cancer to improve patient selection for targeted therapy: a multi-center international study;1782;2019;2a;19.7;Gastroenterology;"Background and Aims: Targeted therapies have shown limited efficacy in gastric cancer, partially due to inadequate patient selection. We performed comprehensive molecular profiling of advanced gastric cancer to identify biomarkers for patient stratification and novel therapeutic targets.

Methods: We conducted a prospective, multi-center international study of 437 patients with advanced gastric or gastroesophageal junction adenocarcinoma. Tumor samples underwent whole-exome sequencing, RNA sequencing, and immunohistochemistry for PD-L1, HER2, and mismatch repair proteins. Plasma samples were collected for cell-free DNA analysis. Primary outcomes were identification of molecular subtypes, therapeutic targets, and biomarkers of response to therapy.

Results: Four distinct molecular subtypes were identified: microsatellite instability-high (MSI-H, 11%), chromosomal instability (CIN, 49%), genomically stable (GS, 20%), and Epstein-Barr virus-positive (EBV, 7%). Each subtype showed unique genomic alterations and gene expression patterns. Potentially actionable alterations were identified in 68% of tumors, including amplifications in ERBB2 (14%), FGFR2 (5%), and MET (4%); mutations in PIK3CA (13%), KRAS (9%), and ERBB2 (5%); and MSI-H (11%) or EBV-positive (7%) status. Concordance between tissue and plasma-based genomic profiling was 87% for single nucleotide variants and 67% for copy number alterations. In an exploratory analysis of 124 patients who received targeted therapies matched to genomic alterations, objective response rate was 50% versus 22% in biomarker-negative patients (P<0.001). Patients with MSI-H tumors showed 63% response rate to immune checkpoint inhibitors versus 12% in microsatellite-stable tumors (P<0.001).

Conclusions: Comprehensive molecular profiling identified distinct subtypes of gastric cancer with therapeutic implications. High concordance between tissue and plasma-based genomic analysis supports the use of liquid biopsies for non-invasive genomic profiling. Molecularly selected patients showed improved responses to targeted therapies, highlighting the importance of biomarker-based patient selection in gastric cancer treatment.";87,126,174,223;Jae-Yong Kim, Timothy Lee, Maria Chen, Andrew Wang, Yuki Tanaka, Sung Kim, Ji-Won Kim, Mei Li, Zheng Chen, Hiroshi Nakamura;Kohortenstudie;Prospektiv, multicenter;Magen;Ja;Nein
Anderson;Miller;A phase 3 trial of CAR-T cell therapy in relapsed/refractory diffuse large B-cell lymphoma after two or more lines of systemic therapy;2874;2021;1b;36.4;New England Journal of Medicine;"Background: CD19-directed chimeric antigen receptor (CAR) T-cell therapy has shown promising results in patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, but randomized studies comparing CAR T-cell therapy with standard care are lacking.

Methods: In this open-label, multicenter, phase 3 trial, we randomly assigned (1:1) patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma after at least two lines of systemic therapy to receive either the CD19-directed CAR T-cell therapy lisocabtagene maraleucel (liso-cel) or standard of care with salvage chemotherapy followed by high-dose chemotherapy and autologous stem-cell transplantation in responding patients. The primary end point was event-free survival, defined as the time from randomization to death, progressive disease, or the start of new antineoplastic therapy.

Results: A total of, 350 patients underwent randomization (174 in the liso-cel group and 176 in the standard-therapy group), and 342 patients received at least one dose of treatment. At a median follow-up of 27.9 months, the median event-free survival was significantly longer in the liso-cel group than in the standard-therapy group (10.1 months vs. 2.3 months; hazard ratio for event or death, 0.35; 95% confidence interval [CI], 0.27 to 0.45; P<0.001). Median progression-free survival was 14.8 months versus 5.7 months (hazard ratio for disease progression or death, 0.41; 95% CI, 0.32 to 0.52; P<0.001), and median overall survival was not reached versus 15.9 months (hazard ratio for death, 0.51; 95% CI, 0.37 to 0.71; P<0.001). The most common grade 3 or 4 adverse events in the liso-cel group were neutropenia (in 80% of patients), anemia (in 45%), and thrombocytopenia (in 48%); cytokine release syndrome of grade 3 or higher occurred in 6% of patients. In the standard-therapy group, grade 3 or 4 neutropenia, anemia, and thrombocytopenia occurred in 51%, 39%, and 28% of patients, respectively.

Conclusions: Among patients with relapsed or refractory large B-cell lymphoma, event-free survival was significantly longer with liso-cel therapy than with standard therapy.";102,147,189,226;Robert Anderson, Sarah Miller, Thomas Wright, Michael Jones, Jennifer Lee, Daniel Brown, Patricia Harris, Steven Wilson, Christine Taylor, Richard Jackson;RCT;Randomisiert, open-label;Lymphom;Ja;Nein
Wang;Nakamura;PARP inhibitor resistance mechanisms in ovarian cancer: clinical implications and emerging therapeutic strategies;1654;2018;1a;15.1;Clinical Cancer Research;"Purpose: Poly(ADP-ribose) polymerase (PARP) inhibitors have transformed the treatment landscape for BRCA-mutated and homologous recombination deficient (HRD) ovarian cancer. However, primary and acquired resistance limit their long-term efficacy. This systematic review synthesizes current knowledge on PARP inhibitor resistance mechanisms and explores emerging strategies to overcome resistance.

Methods: We systematically searched MEDLINE, Embase, and Web of Science databases (January 2006 to December 2017) for studies investigating mechanisms of PARP inhibitor resistance in ovarian cancer. Clinical trials, preclinical studies, and mechanistic investigations were included. Two independent reviewers screened studies, extracted data, and assessed quality using modified PRISMA guidelines.

Results: We identified 64 eligible studies. Resistance mechanisms were classified into five categories: (i) restoration of homologous recombination repair through BRCA reversion mutations, demethylation of BRCA promoters, or stabilization of mutant BRCA proteins; (ii) protection of replication forks via downregulation of MRE11, PTIP, or CHD4; (iii) loss of PARP1 expression or activity; (iv) upregulation of drug efflux transporters like P-glycoprotein; and (v) rewiring of cellular metabolism. BRCA reversion mutations emerged as the most clinically validated resistance mechanism, detected in 18-46% of patients progressing on PARP inhibitors. Reversion mutations were associated with shorter progression-free survival (hazard ratio, 2.34; 95% CI, 1.58-3.48; P<0.001) and poorer response rates. Novel therapeutic strategies to overcome resistance include combinations with ATR inhibitors, WEE1 inhibitors, immune checkpoint inhibitors, and anti-angiogenic agents, with promising preliminary results in early-phase clinical trials.

Conclusions: Multiple mechanisms contribute to PARP inhibitor resistance in ovarian cancer. Understanding these resistance pathways has led to rational combination strategies currently in clinical development. Biomarker-driven adaptive treatment approaches based on resistance mechanisms may improve outcomes for patients with PARP inhibitor-resistant ovarian cancer.";76,98,142,175;Andrew Wang, Hiroshi Nakamura, Maria Chen, Yuki Tanaka, Sung Kim, Ji-Won Kim, Mei Li, Zheng Chen, Jae-Yong Kim, Timothy Lee;Metaanalyse;Systematische Review;Ovar;Ja;Ja
Martinez;Rodriguez;Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes as predictive biomarkers of response to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in triple-negative breast cancer: a systematic review and meta-analysis;1433;2021;1a;17.2;NPJ Breast Cancer;"Background: Tumor-infiltrating lymphocytes (TILs) have emerged as a potential biomarker for treatment response in triple-negative breast cancer (TNBC). We conducted a systematic review and meta-analysis to evaluate the association between TILs and pathological complete response (pCR) to neoadjuvant chemotherapy in patients with TNBC.

Methods: We systematically searched PubMed, Embase, and Cochrane databases from inception to June 2020 for studies reporting the association between TILs and pCR in TNBC patients receiving neoadjuvant chemotherapy. The primary outcome was the odds ratio (OR) for achieving pCR based on TIL levels (high vs. low). Secondary analyses included the association between specific TIL subsets (CD8+, CD4+, FOXP3+) and pCR. Random-effects models were used for all analyses.

Results: Twenty-six studies comprising 3,328 patients with TNBC were included. High TIL levels were significantly associated with increased probability of pCR compared with low TIL levels (OR, 2.91; 95% confidence interval [CI], 2.34-3.62; P<0.001). Each 10% increase in TILs was associated with a 19% increase in pCR rate (OR, 1.19; 95% CI, 1.14-1.25; P<0.001). Among TIL subsets, high CD8+ T cells showed the strongest association with pCR (OR, 2.67; 95% CI, 1.83-3.91; P<0.001), followed by CD4+ T cells (OR, 1.92; 95% CI, 1.32-2.78; P<0.001), while FOXP3+ regulatory T cells showed no significant association (OR, 1.29; 95% CI, 0.85-1.94; P=0.232). The association between TILs and pCR was consistent across different neoadjuvant chemotherapy regimens, including anthracycline-taxane combinations, platinum-based regimens, and those incorporating carboplatin.

Conclusions: High TIL levels, particularly CD8+ T cells, are significantly associated with increased likelihood of achieving pCR after neoadjuvant chemotherapy in TNBC. These findings support the incorporation of TIL assessment into clinical practice and trial designs as a potential predictive biomarker for treatment response in TNBC.";67,94,136,172;Ana Martinez, Maria Rodriguez, Carlos Garcia, John Parker, Elena Volkova, Sergei Ivanov, Tatsuo Miyamoto, Laura Torres, Hector Gomez, Akira Yoshida;Metaanalyse;Systematische Review;Mamma;Ja;Ja
